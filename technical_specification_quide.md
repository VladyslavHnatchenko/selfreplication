What does the application do?

    - This web application requests access to the user's GitHub account.
    - Then it builds a repository in user's account with its own code.
    - Finally with a help of one URL user can replicate existing repository to his own account.

How does the application work?

    - Firstly, with a help of OAuth application, our app tries to access the user's GitHub account.
    - Then, our app creates a link to repository with a help of the constant name of repository and
        user's name (your GitHub username).
    - On the last step, our app builds a link for replicating repository and makes
        a replication - again with a help of user's name (your GitHub username) and
        constant repository name.
    - On the homepage you can press the button for redirection to your repository with
        the replicated code.
